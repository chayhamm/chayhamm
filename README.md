## About me

• I''ve worked on many Game Servers - Where I had to regularly engage with the community.
    ∙ Doing this has helped me develop my social skills.

• Whilst working on the Game Servers, I had to constantly put my programming skills to use.
    ∙ This has helped me reach my highest potential within programming.


However, I primarily focus on helping & supporting others within the online community and within the real world community; and I feel ready to put my social helpfulness to use.
