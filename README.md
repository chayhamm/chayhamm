## About me

I am a freelance developer who is currently focusing on building up my skills for the future. Right now, I am focused on JavaScript; and app Development - In React (JS Framework).
The programming languages I know are - C#, Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, HTML; I focus on more, more than others.

I am mostly self taught, however I did do Computer Science at GCSE level in Secondary School - which only taught me Python basics; and I went on to develop my Python skills by myself - using libraries like Discord.py and Pycord.

## Past projects

**Endure Rust 10x**:

    I have developed and ran a 10x Rust Server - which went nowhere; but, in doing so, I developed my C# and Python skills - using Oxide for C# and Discord.py for Python.


**Relaunch Studios**:

    A freelance app development company which is still in development; this has made me learn Kotlin and JavaScript.
