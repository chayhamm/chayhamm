## About me

*Hello, my name is Chay; and I am an aspiring game developer. I have always been on and off with developing and what I would like to do with it in the future. But I finally decided that I wanted to do something with C# - and game development seemed like it was the best for me.*

*I have currently not done anything with helping towards game-development;* 
*and I am just practicing my C# skills by making Discord-Bots (DSharpPlus); and Rust-Plugins (For the Game).*

*When I do something towards my Game-Development journey, I will **Most-Likely** Post about it on my GitHub page.*

## Projects

As of now, I have not made many projects. 

I have made some Discord-Bots (using *Discord.py*) for some graphic designers and VFX workers.

I have made some Rust-Plugins (for the game) just for testing (using C#)
